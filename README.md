# techdocumentationpage
In this project, I made use of HTML and CSS to build a technical documentation page.
I made use of various elements such as:
* nav
* section
* code
* header

While styling the HTML file, I made use of the *position* property to position the navbar and the content of the page to different portions of the page.
With the position property set to fixed. I kept the navbar stationary as a user scrolls through the content.
I also made use of *media queries* to change the position of the navbar to the side or top based on the size of the screen.
