        <p>Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.

          <p>We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.

         <p>There it is. We don't have anything but happy trees here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. You are only limited by your imagination. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.

         <p>Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. In your world you have total and absolute power. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.

         <p>Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. See there how easy that is. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud.

         <p>In this world, everything can be happy. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let's have a happy little tree in here. You gotta think like a tree. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Let's put a touch more of the magic here.

         <p>You gotta think like a tree. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

         <p>Play with the angles. It's all a game of angles. Be brave. Just make little strokes like that.

         <p>That easy. Trees grow however makes them happy. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. A beautiful little sunset.

         <p>Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.
